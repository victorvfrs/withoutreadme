Then add the file and push the file. To create the branch remotely we have to use git push --set-upstream origin branchname

Switch the branch again to the master using git checkout master

As the merge command is used the new create branch will be merged to the master branch and the file will be inserted to it. Previously, we have 2 file in the master, now there are 3 files. Make sure to push the files using git
